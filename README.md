# Broser Default Page

This is supposed to be set as your default page inside of the browser.

It shows you the time and a cool background image generated by <a href="https://unsplash.com">Unsplash</a>.
You can also change the tags of the image inside of the CSS.
Whenever you click on the screen it is going to redirect you to Google.com (but it can be changed of course).
